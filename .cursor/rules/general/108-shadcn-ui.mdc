## Context

* We use Shadcn/UI to style our application.

## Rules

- Each time you need a Shadcn UI component, check if required Shadcn UI component you need already exists in @/components/ui folder.
- If doesn't exist in the ui folder, you must install ShadcnUI required components with command `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`.
- If no ShadcnUI components to install and we need a new reusable components, create it in @/components/ui folder.
- You must use Shadcn UI for components.
- You must use Tailwind CSS for styling.
