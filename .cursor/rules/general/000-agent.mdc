- Write concise, technical TypeScript code using functional and declarative programming patterns.
- Avoid classes; prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files into: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

## syntax-and-formatting

- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Write declarative JSX.

## typescript-usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types.
- Add interfaces and enums only in the @/types directory so they can be imported from any code file.

## folders-structure

- Cursor rules to follow in `@/.cursor`.
- Next App router system
- All project routes in `@/app` folder. Follow [105-nextjs-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/105-nextjs-routes.mdc) to create new routes.
- `@/components` folder must contains components reusables in entire project, like ui components (Shadcn UI), layouts components, providers components, etc.
- `@/config` folder includes the main config project file, permit to manage some project elements.
- `@/lib` folder must contains reusable libraries utils like prisma client, better auth utils, send email functions, storage functions, forms schemas, etc.
- All Next API routes must be include in `@/app/api` folder, organized by project features (auth, users, etc.).
- When a route page need specific components, create it in a _components folder in the route page folder.

## components-rules

- Follow [101-client-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/101-client-components.mdc) when need a client component.
- Follow [107-server-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/107-server-components.mdc) when need a server component.
- Follow [114-server-actions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/114-server-actions.mdc) when need to manage server actions.
- Follow [113-api-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/113-api-routes.mdc) when need to manage API routes.

## ui-and-styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach.
- Use only date-fns to display dates in UI.
- Follow [108-shadcn-ui.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/108-shadcn-ui.mdc) and [111-tailwind-styles.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/111-tailwind-styles.mdc) rules for designing pages and components.

## form-management

- Use a combination of react-hook-form and zod to manage forms in the project.
- Use component `@/components/commmon/form-builder.tsx` when need to create new form in project.
- Forms have to be construct on specific component file and set on the _components folder of the concerned part.
- Set all zod schema in @/lib/schemas folder.

## performance-optimization

- Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in `Suspense` with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, and implement lazy loading.

## database-querying-and-data-model-creation

- Use Prisma ORM to query the database.
- For data models, follow rules on [112-prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/112-prisma.mdc) file.

## key-conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client': Favor server components and Next.js SSR for data fetching or state management.
- Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.

## Output

- Always write code in English
- Always write UI in English
- Do not add comments

## Terminal

- AWLAYS use `yarn`
