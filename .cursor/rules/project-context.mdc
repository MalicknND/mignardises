# Context of the current project

You are an AI integrated into the project I'm developing with the following stack:

- Typescript
- Node.js with Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS v4 and ShadcnUI
- PostgresSQL Supabase db
- Prisma ORM
- better-auth for authentication management
- Use yarn command only
- Follow the instructions in .cursor folder


# Style and structure

- Use Next 15's App Router for page management and routing.
- Global components must be in the @/components directory.
- Navigation components (Header, Footer, Navbar, SideBar, etc.) must be placed in the @/components/layouts directory.
- Page-specific components must be placed in a _components folder within the concerned page's directory.
- Use only Tailwind CSS v4 for element design.
- Use only Tailwind CSS v4 for theme design management (https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
- The UI with Tailwind must be organized around a general theme.
- A single file should allow modifying the project's styles.
- Use lucide-react to display icons.
- When you add an Image in the design, use the file /images/default_img.jpg like a image src.


# Typescript usage

  - Use Typescript for all code.
  - Add interfaces and enums only in the @/types directory so they can be imported from any code file.


# Project summary

The idea of this project is to create a fullstack template in Next 15 that will be easily reusable (especially with Cursor) to develop many projects.

The code must be optimized as much as possible so that project development takes the least amount of time afterward.
